# Your Travel Companion Hub
[Project requirements/instructions here](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/cmpt-276/#/project)

# Project Objectives
- To create a web-based "travel hub" application using react.js to integrate Amadeus and OpenWeather APIs so that users can easily search for flights, hotels and weather for prospective travel destinations.
- To use Kanban as our SDLC through the development process to document progress and needs.
- To use and create project elements that exist in real-world software development throughout our project such as a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Github issues, CI/CD infrastructure, wireframes and prototypes, user stories, and Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs).

# Tech Stack
[React.js](https://react.dev/learn)

Javascript based framework that makes use of components (UI elements) which have logic and appearance features. It is a modern framework that had good performance and lots of capability and community support.

# Setup Instructions
Can be built locally by downloading our main branch as a zip file, extracting the contents and running npm start in ~/travel-app/src (may require an npm install and npm install react-datepicker --save run for components to work) will cause the app to be run at http://localhost:3000/cmpt-276-fall-2023-cmpt-276-project). This will lack images but does show the general outline of the app and feature working api calls and functionality.

Our live production website is viewable in the github project page description and shows images/full fledged design.
