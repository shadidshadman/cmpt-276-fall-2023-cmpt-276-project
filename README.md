# Project - Your Travel Companion Hub
[Project requirements/instructions here](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/cmpt-276/#/project)

# Project Objectives
- To create a web-based "travel hub" application using react.js to integrate Amadeus, Google Calendar, and AccuWeather APIs so that users can easily search for and build their travel itineraries (even booking through the application itself).
- To use Kanban as our SDLC through the development process to document progress and needs.
- To use and create project elements that exist in real-world software development throughout our project such as a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Github issues, CI/CD infrastructure, wireframes and prototypes, user stories, and Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs).

# Tech Stack
[React.js](https://react.dev/learn)

Javascript based framework that makes use of components (UI elements) which have logic and appearance features. It is a modern framework that had good performance and lots of capability and community support.
